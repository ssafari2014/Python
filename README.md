# Hello, welcome to the boot camp. My name is Sajjad. Let's have a great time together with great projects
# Python
I will put all the work I have done with Python in this section
Python is a powerful language and I enjoy working with it
In this section, a simple calculator has been designed that will be updated soon and I hope you enjoy it

The way to work with this method is to calculate a number, then get the type of calculation and get the second number, but because you might want to use the result of the previous calculation in the new calculation, I have put the possibility of using the result of the previous calculation here for Azir users.
